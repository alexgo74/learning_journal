# LJ Code 201 - Day 8

This week is going really well compared to what I thought it would be at first. All the things that we've been building on finally is taking form. I felt I was getting lost but suddenly it has changed for the better. Now I can understand where I  stand when it comes to functions, objects and constructors. I really like the way "hard" and no "so hard" material is getting blended into my learning process.
