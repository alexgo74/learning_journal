# LJ Code 201 - Day 6

This week started with a lot of new stuff. We started working with functions, objects and the DOM tree. There is so much I did not know that I felt overwhelmed at first. As the day went on things start to make sense. We kept creating branches for a new project and now I have a better understanding of objects and element nodes.
I am feel excited about this week.
