# LJ Code 201 - Day 5

This week was awesome. We got to use Git and GitHub more and more. We had some quizzes and labs which helped our learning in a more permanent way. We got to practice with arrays and functions in JS and we went over images, boxes and different types of images files in CSS.
We learned how to do pair programming and branching.
I believe I am getting better at using the Terminal and the GitHub GUI.
We did a lot in just a week!!!
