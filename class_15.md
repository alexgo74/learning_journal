# LJ Code 201 - Day 15

This was the first day of our project. We decided to work on a matching game. We made our plan according to all the requirements. We divided the work and got everything set up.
I got some wireframes and CSS done today. I also worked on the random function and pair programmed with Brian. We stopped at 6 pm and now I am heading home.
