# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

What I learned so far has been more than what I expected. We've been working on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Mostly JavaScript, but that makes a lot sense. Decision making and Looping  are no joke but great tools. Also, Control Flow and CSS boxes are so important to learn. A lot of material is being thrown at us and at the same time, we have all the support we need to complete the assignments and building on what we practice every day.
